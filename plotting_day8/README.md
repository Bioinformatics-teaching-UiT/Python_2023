## Afternoon session

- We spend more time on [exercise part 3](https://coderefinery.github.io/data-visualization-python/customizing-plots/#exercises): **plot your own data**
  - Try to get a plot to work which is close to your study/research/interest
  - If you do not have own data, here are some starting points:
    - <https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data>
    - <https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/>
    - <https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html>
- Share and discuss our examples via shared screen
  - Q&A
  - Solving problems
  - More Python learning
- Optional exercise: [Linear and non-linear regression](https://coderefinery.github.io/data-visualization-python/regression/)
